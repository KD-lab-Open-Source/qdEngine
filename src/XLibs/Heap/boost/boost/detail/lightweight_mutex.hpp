//  typedef <unspecified> boost::detail::lightweight_mutex;
//
//  boost::detail::lightweight_mutex meets a subset of the Mutex concept
//  requirements: http://www.boost.org/libs/thread/doc/mutex_concept.html#Mutex
//
//  * Used by the smart pointer library
//  * Performance oriented
//  * Header-only implementation
//  * Small memory footprint
//  * Not a general purpose mutex, use boost::mutex, CRITICAL_SECTION or
//    pthread_mutex instead.
//  * Never spin in a tight lock/do-something/unlock loop, since
//    lightweight_mutex does not guarantee fairness.
//  * Never keep a lightweight_mutex locked for long periods.
//
//  The current implementation can use a pthread_mutex, a CRITICAL_SECTION,
//  or a platform-specific spinlock.
//
//  You can force a particular implementation by defining BOOST_LWM_USE_PTHREADS,
//  BOOST_LWM_USE_CRITICAL_SECTION, or BOOST_LWM_USE_SPINLOCK.
//
//  If neither macro has been defined, the default is to use a spinlock on Win32,
//  and a pthread_mutex otherwise.
//
//  Note that a spinlock is not a general synchronization primitive. In particular,
//  it is not guaranteed to be a memory barrier, and it is possible to "livelock"
//  if a lower-priority thread has acquired the spinlock but a higher-priority
//  thread is spinning trying to acquire the same lock.
//
//  For these reasons, spinlocks have been disabled by default except on Windows,
//  where a spinlock can be several orders of magnitude faster than a CRITICAL_SECTION.


//  Note: lwm_linux.hpp has been disabled by default; see the comments
//        inside for more info.


#include <boost/config.hpp>

//  Note to implementors: if you write a platform-specific spinlock
//  for a platform that supports pthreads, be sure to test its performance
//  against the pthreads-based version using shared_ptr_timing_test.cpp and
//  shared_ptr_mt_test.cpp. Custom versions are usually not worth the trouble
//  _unless_ the performance gains are substantial.
//
//  Be sure to compare against a "real" pthreads library;
//  shared_ptr_timing_test.cpp will compile succesfully with a stub do-nothing
//  pthreads library, since it doesn't create any threads.
